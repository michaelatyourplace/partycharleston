                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">It's 1:45 AM. The lights just came on at Uptown, the DJ cut the music at Share House, and thousands of people are pouring onto King Street. Your ears are ringing, your feet hurt, and you are *starving*. This is the most critical moment of your night.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">Where do you go? Making the wrong choice means a 45-minute wait for a mediocre slice. Making the right choice is the perfect end to an epic night. We've done the "research" so you don't have to. This is the definitive guide to late-night food on King Street.</p>

            <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/ecc94b/black?text=Late-Night+Pizza+Slice" alt="A person holding a perfect slice of pizza on a street at night" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12 w-full">

            <h2>The Late-Night Champions</h2>
            <p>When it's that late, you have three primary needs: pizza, tacos, or something greasy. Here are the champions of each category.</p>

            <h3>The Pizza Gods: Benny's & Paolo's</h3>
            
            <h3>1. Benny's (Benny Palmetto's)</h3>
            <p>This is the undisputed king of the 2 AM "mass exodus" from Upper King. Located right on King Street near the action, Benny's serves one thing: gigantic, New York-style pizza slices. The line will look terrifying—it will stretch down the block. But don't be fooled. They are built for volume. The line moves incredibly fast. You can be in and out with your massive, foldable, perfect slice in under 10 minutes. It's a well-oiled machine and a Charleston rite of passage.</p>

            <h3>2. Paolo's Gelato & Pizza</h3>
            <p>Located on Market Street, this is the go-to for the Mid-King and Lower King crowd. It's a classic, no-frills pizza-by-the-slice joint that has been serving the late-night crowd for years. The pizza is fantastic, and they also have gelato if you're in the mood for a different kind of late-night snack. It's a slightly more "old-school Charleston" feel than Benny's.</p>

            <h3>The Taco Hero: Fuel Cantina</h3>
            <p>Tucked away on Rutledge Ave (one block over from King), Fuel is a Caribbean-inspired cantina in a converted, retro gas station. While it's a great bar in its own right, its late-night window is a lifesaver. You can walk up and grab amazing tacos, street corn, and other quick bites. It's the perfect way to dodge the pizza-fueled chaos on King Street and get something with a little more flavor. A true local's secret.</p>

            <h3>The Greasy Spoon Legend: The Royal American</h3>
            <p>This is a "pro-move." While the college crowd swarms Benny's, the local industry crowd and <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/parties/college.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">CofC students in-the-know</a> head to The Royal American (on Morrison Drive, a short walk from Upper King). Their kitchen stays open late, and their bar food is *unbelievably* good. We're talking loaded tater tots, amazing burgers, and fried chicken sandwiches. It's a bar, so you have to be 21+, but it's the perfect spot to wind down *with* amazing food instead of just grabbing it on the go.</p>

            <h3>The "You Need a Real Meal" Option: Cook Out</h3>
            <p>Let's be honest. Sometimes you don't want a $5 slice. You want a 1,000-calorie tray of a burger, fries, and a milkshake for $8. The Cook Out on Savannah Highway (a short Uber ride from downtown) is the 24/7 mecca for this. Piling into an Uber with your friends and making a "Cook Out run" is a sacred post-party ritual. If you need to sober up with a massive, cheap meal, this is your destination.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2>The Verdict: Your Late-Night Food Plan</h2>
            <p>Your choice of late-night food says a lot about your <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/king-street-bar-crawl/index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">King Street bar crawl</a> strategy.
