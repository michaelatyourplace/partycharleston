                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You see "King Street Bar Crawl" everywhere, but half your group is under 21. Does that mean the bachelorette party is a bust? Absolutely not. The secret is to stop thinking of King Street as just a collection of bars and start seeing it for what it really is: a mile-long runway of fashion, food, and fun.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">This is your guide to the *other* King Street crawl—one that's all about experiences, world-class desserts, and late-night laughs, no ID required. Plus, we'll cover the "sleep in" part: where to have that perfect, lazy bachelorette brunch. Instead of evening need a midday idea?

            <!-- Section 1: The "Crawl" -->
            <h2>Phase 1: The "Crawl" (The All-Ages King Street Experience)</h2>
            <p>Your "crawl" starts in the afternoon and goes right into the night. It's all about capturing that "main character" energy with the whole group.</p>

            <h3>The Pre-Game: Shopping & Sightseeing (4 PM - 7 PM)</h3>
            <p>This is the true "King Street" experience. Start on Lower King (below Market Street) and browse the high-end window displays at Gucci and Louis Vuitton. As you walk north past Market, you'll hit the core shopping district with stores like Sephora, Lululemon, and tons of local boutiques. This is the perfect time for the group to find accessories for the night, people-watch, and just soak in the scene. Stop for a group photo at the corner of Market and King, one of the most iconic intersections in the city.</p>

            <h3>The Main Event: Group Activities (7 PM - 9 PM)</h3>
            <p>This is where you plan your anchor activity. Instead of a bar, you're booking an *experience*.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Top Pick: Break Out Charleston.</strong> It's an escape room located right on King Street. It's the perfect ice-breaker and a high-energy, collaborative way to spend an hour. (Mentioned in our <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/options-under-21/beyond-the-bar-all-ages.html" class="prose under-21-link">all-ages night out guide</a>).</li>
                <li><strong>The Creative Pick:</strong> Book a private candle-making class at <strong>Candlefish</strong>. It's a classic bachelorette move for a reason. It's fun, hands-on, and everyone gets a party favor.</li>
                <li><strong>The Laugh-Out-Loud Pick:</strong> Go to an improv show at <strong>Theatre 99</strong>. It's cheap, hilarious, and a perfect all-ages group activity.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>The "Nightcap": The Dessert Crawl (9 PM - Late)</h3>
            <p>This is your "bar hop." After your activity, it's time for the legendary Charleston dessert scene. These aren't just restaurants; they are late-night social hubs.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stop 1: Kaminsky's Dessert Café.</strong> This is your "cozy, romantic" stop. It's known for its dim lighting and massive, towering cakes. Get a few to share.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop 2: Carmella's Cafe & Dessert Bar.</strong> This is your "high-energy" stop. It's bright, loud, and feels like a party. Get gelato or their famous cannoli cake. We broke down the full battle in our <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/options-under-21/late-night-desserts.html" class="prose under-21-link">Late-Night Dessert Battle guide</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop 3: Kudu Coffee.</strong> If you're not ready to go home, grab a late-night coffee and sit in their magical courtyard. It's a key <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/options-under-21/late-night-coffee-hangouts.html" class="prose under-21-link">social hangout</a> for the under-21 crowd.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 2: The "Sleep In Fun" -->
            <h2>Phase 2: The "Sleep In Fun" (The Bachelorette Brunch)</h2>
            <p>After a long night of walking and eating, the "sleep in" is key. The grand finale of your under-21 bachelorette party is the iconic Charleston brunch. Here are the top spots for a fun, group-friendly (and delicious) morning-after meal.</p>

            <h3>1. Miller's All Day</h3>
            <p>Located on Lower King, Miller's is an Instagram dream. It's a retro, stylish diner that's famous for one thing: breakfast all day. The vibes are immaculate. It's perfect for a group that wants to take photos, eat delicious pancakes and bacon, and debrief on the night before. Be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it.</p>

            <h3>2. Poogan's Porch</h3>
            <p>A true Charleston classic. You'll be eating in a beautiful, historic Victorian house, and the food is pure, upscale Southern comfort. Think shrimp and grits, massive biscuits, and chicken and waffles. It's the quintessential "Southern Bachelorette" experience and a fantastic way to end the trip on a high note.</p>

            <h3>3. The "At Home" Option: Callie's Hot Little Biscuit</h3>
            <p>Don't want to get dressed and face a 2-hour wait with a big group? Send one person on a "biscuit run" to Callie's Hot Little Biscuit. Bring back a dozen of their incredible, buttery biscuits (in all flavors) to the hotel or Airbnb. Pair with some coffee, and you have the most delicious, low-stress bachelorette brunch imaginable.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2>The Verdict: An Unforgettable Bachelorette</h2>
            <p>See? You can have a full, "classic" Charleston bachelorette party weekend without ever worrying about a 21+ wristband. The King Street experience is about the energy, the food, and the fashion—all of which are perfectly accessible for an under-21 group. It's all about swapping the "bar crawl" for a "dessert crawl" and enjoying the best of what the city has to offer.</p>
