                <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Why a Creative Workshop is the Perfect Bachelorette Party Starter</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You've arrived, checked into the Airbnb, and the "Bride Tribe" sashes are on. Now what? The first event of a bachelorette party can be awkward. People are just arriving, and not everyone knows each other. This is where a creative workshop comes in—it's the ultimate ice-breaker.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">And in Charleston, one workshop rules them all: the <strong>Candlefish candle-making class</strong>. It's a fun, hands-on, all-ages activity that's become a rite of passage for bachelorette parties. We break down why it's the perfect choice, plus a few other great options.</p>

            <!-- Candlefish Section -->
            <h2>The Main Event: Candlefish Candle-Making</h2>
            <p>Located right on King Street, Candlefish is perfectly positioned to be the first stop on your party itinerary. It's part-gorgeous boutique, part-workshop. Booking a private class for your group is easy and guarantees you a fun, memorable, 90-minute activity that everyone will love.</p>
            
            <h3>What's the Experience Like?</h3>
            <p>This isn't just "arts and crafts." It's a full sensory experience. You'll be led by a "chandler" (a professional candle-maker) in their beautiful workshop. The process involves:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Scent Library:</strong> You'll start at their famous "scent library," sampling dozens of unique, sophisticated fragrances to find your perfect one. This part alone is a blast, as everyone compares notes ("This one smells like a library!" "This one is pure beach!").</li>
                <li><strong>The Process:</strong> The chandler walks you through the entire process: wicking your jars, measuring the wax, and mixing in your chosen fragrance oil. It's hands-on and just technical enough to be interesting, but simple enough that anyone can do it.</li>
                <li><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The best part for a mixed-age group is that it's BYOB. This means the 21+ members of your group can pop a bottle of champagne, while the under-21 members can enjoy a fun mocktail or sparkling cider. Everyone feels included, and it sets a fun, celebratory tone.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>The Payoff</h3>
            <p>You'll have to let your candles cool and set, which means you can't take them home immediately. This is actually a *perk*. You'll come back the next day (or later) to pick them up, and everyone leaves with a high-quality, custom-made candle. It's the perfect bachelorette party favor that isn't just another koozie.</p>

            <!-- Other Options -->
            <h2>Other Great Workshop Ideas</h2>
            <p>Love the idea but candles aren't the bride's thing? Charleston has other amazing group workshops perfect for an all-ages party.</p>

            <h3>For the Foodie Bride: A Cooking Class</h3>
            <p>Charleston is a food city, so why not learn from the best? Several places offer private group classes. You can learn to make classic Lowcountry biscuits, fresh pasta, or delicate French macarons. It's a 2-3 hour activity that's incredibly fun, collaborative, and ends with you eating a delicious meal together. It's both an activity and a dinner, all in one.</p>

            <h3>For the "Plant Mom" Bride: A Floral Workshop</h3>
            <p>For a beautiful, 'gram-worthy afternoon, book a private floral arranging workshop. Places like "Festoon" or "Petaloso" will host your group, provide all the flowers and a vase, and teach you how to create a stunning, professional-looking centerpiece. It's relaxing, creative, and everyone can take their arrangement back to the Airbnb to decorate the space for the weekend.</p>

            <h3>For the Artsy Bride: A "Sip and Paint" (with a Twist)</h3>
            <p>A "sip and paint" is a bachelorette classic. Like Candlefish, these studios are almost always BYOB, making them perfect for mixed-age groups. Everyone can sip on their drink of choice while following an instructor to paint a Charleston-themed canvas (like Rainbow Row or the Pineapple Fountain). It's low-stress, full of laughs, and everyone gets a souvenir to take home.</p>

            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <h2>The Verdict: Book the Ice-Breaker</h2>
            <p>Starting your <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/under-21-bachelorette/index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Charleston bachelorette weekend</a> with a creative workshop is a guaranteed win. It solves the "first night" problem, gives your group a fun focus, and ensures everyone has a great time, regardless of their age. It sets the perfect collaborative and fun tone for the rest of the trip.</p>
