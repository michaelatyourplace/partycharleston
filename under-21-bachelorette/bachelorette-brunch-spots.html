                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">The "Sleep In Fun" is a sacred part of the bachelorette weekend. After two days of partying, you need a lazy morning that ends with a spectacular meal. In Charleston, brunch isn't just a meal; it's a competitive sport.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You need a spot that can handle a group, has amazing food, and most importantly, passes the "vibe check" for the group photos. Here are the most 'gram-worthy, group-friendly brunch spots in the city.</p>

            <!-- The List -->
            <h2>The "Must-Go" Bachelorette Brunch List</h2>

            <h3>1. Poogan's Porch</h3>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Classic Southern Charm. You'll be dining in a beautiful, historic Victorian house with a sprawling front porch. It's the quintessential "Southern Bachelorette" photo-op.</p>
            <p><strong>The Food:</strong> This is pure, upscale Lowcountry comfort. Their chicken and waffles are legendary, the shrimp and grits are perfection, and you *must* start with an order of their giant, fluffy biscuits for the table. It's hearty, delicious, and exactly the kind of food you want to eat in Charleston. The 21+ crowd can get mimosas, and the under-21s will be just as happy with sweet tea.
            <br>
            <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Reservations are essential and must be made *far* in advance for a group.</p>

            <h3>2. Miller's All Day</h3>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Retro-Chic & Instagram-Famous. Located on Lower King, Miller's is a stunning, retro-style diner that was practically built for Instagram. With its cool tiled floors, bright lighting, and stylish bar, every corner is a photo-op.</p>
            <p><strong>The Food:</strong> Famous for its all-day breakfast and commitment to grains (they mill their own!). Their "Unicorn Grits" (milled from unicorn corn) and giant, fluffy pancakes are staples. It's a "cool-girl" spot that perfectly balances style and substance.
            <br>
            <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> They don't take reservations for brunch, so the wait for a group on a weekend will be long. Send one person to put your name in while the rest of the group shops on Lower King.</p>

            <h3>3. Camellias (at Hotel Bennett)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Over-the-Top Pink Luxury. This is it. This is "extra." Camellias is a stunning, all-pink champagne and dessert bar in the Hotel Bennett. While known for champagne, it's also famous for its afternoon "High Tea" and dessert. If your bride wants to feel like royalty, this is the place.</p>
            <p><strong>The Food:</strong> Think tiny, perfect finger sandwiches, exquisite pastries, and beautiful cakes. It's less "hearty brunch" and more "elegant, sophisticated high tea." For a mixed-age group, this is perfect. Everyone can enjoy the tea service, and the 21+ crowd can add champagne.
            <br>
            <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Reservations are an absolute must, and there's a dress code. This is a "put on your nice dress" event.</p>

            <h3>4. Élevé Rooftop Restaurant & Lounge</h3>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Whimsical, Artsy Rooftop. Located at the Grand Bohemian Hotel, Élevé is a visual feast. The decor is eclectic and art-filled, and the rooftop terrace feels like a secret garden. It's a fantastic spot for a group that wants a "rooftop" experience in the daylight.</p>
            <p><strong>The Food:</strong> A great mix of classic brunch items (like Eggs Benedict) and more creative, upscale dishes. The food is solid, but you're really here for the whimsical atmosphere and the unique rooftop setting.
            <br>
            <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Make a reservation and request a table on the terrace if the weather is nice.</p>

            <h3>5. Callie's Hot Little Biscuit (The "At Home" Option)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The Genius Low-Stress Move. Let's be real: getting a group of 8-10 people dressed and to a reservation by 11 AM on the last day is *hard*. The best brunch might be the one at your Airbnb.
            <img src="https://placehold.co/800x300/f9a8d4/white?text=A+Box+of+Callie's+Hot+Little+Biscuits" alt="A box full of delicious-looking biscuits from Callie's" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg my-12 w-full">
            <p><strong>The Food:</strong> Send two "biscuit runners" to the Callie's Hot Little Biscuit on King Street right when they open. Get two dozen of their assorted, life-changing biscuits (country ham, blackberry, cheese & chive) and a tub of pimento cheese. Bring them back to the Airbnb, make a pot of coffee, and have the most delicious, relaxing, and stress-free "brunch-in" of all time.
            <br>
            <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> The line at Callie's is famous. Go early, or better yet, pre-order online for pickup.</p>
