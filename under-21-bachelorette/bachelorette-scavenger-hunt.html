            <p>Give each team this list. They must get a photo (or video) of their *entire team* doing each task. First team to complete it and meet at the finish line (e.g., Kaminsky's for dessert) wins!</p>

            <h3>The "Landmarks" List (Gotta Get 'Em All)</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Find another bachelorette party and get a group photo with them. (30 points - *Bonus 10 points if you get the other bride!*)</li>
                <li>Get a "words of wisdom" marriage-advice video from a couple who has been married 20+ years. (25 points)</li>
                <li>A photo of the team "cheers-ing" with a non-alcoholic drink (e.g., coffee, sweet tea, or a cone from Jeni's). (15 points)</li>
                <li>A photo of a team member posing like a mannequin in a King Street shop window. (20 points)</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Get a business card from a bartender or server... for the bride. (10 points)</li>
                <li>A photo of the entire team with a horse from a carriage tour (be nice and ask!). (15 points)</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Scavenger Hunt Pro-Tip:</strong> Create a custom hashtag for the party (e.g., #SarahsLastSailCHS) and have teams post their photos to Instagram Stories as they go. It's a fun way to track each other's progress and creates a perfect digital scrapbook of the activity.
            </blockquote>

            <!-- How to Plan -->
            <h2>How to Make it a Success</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Set Clear Rules</h3>
            <p>The rules are simple: stay together as a team, don't be a nuisance (be respectful to locals!), and meet back at the designated time. Set a "punishment" for the last-place team (e.g., they buy the first round of dessert for the winning team).</p>
            
            <h3>2. Pick a Great Finish Line</h3>
            <p>The end-point is key. It needs to be somewhere everyone can get into. We recommend an all-ages spot like the <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/options-under-21/late-night-desserts.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Kaminsky's Dessert Café</a>, the courtyard at <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/options-under-21/late-night-coffee-hangouts.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Kudu Coffee</a>, or a casual restaurant. This is where you'll crown the winners and look through all the hilarious photos.</p>

            <h3>3. Have a Small Prize</h3>
            <p>It doesn't have to be big! A prize for the winning team makes it more competitive. Think "a round of drinks/desserts," "a custom shot glass for each member," or just "bragging rights for the rest of the trip."</p>

            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <h2>The Verdict: The Best Free Activity</h2>
            <p>A DIY scavenger hunt is the perfect activity for the afternoon of Day 1 or Day 2 of your <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/under-21-bachelorette/index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">all-ages bachelorette weekend</a>. It's fun, it's competitive, it's 100% free, and it forces your group to explore and interact with the best parts of historic Charleston. You'll end up with hundreds of amazing, candid photos and a memory the bride will never forget.</p>
