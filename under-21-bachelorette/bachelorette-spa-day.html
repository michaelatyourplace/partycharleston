                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">After a day of walking King Street and a night of dessert-hopping, your group needs a break. A luxury spa day is the perfect bachelorette "Day 2" activity. It's relaxing, sophisticated, and a fantastic way for the whole group to bond and recharge, regardless of age.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">But planning a spa day for a *group* can be tricky. You can't just walk in. Here's a guide to the best spas in Charleston for groups and how to book them properly.</p>

            <h2>The Best Charleston Spas for Groups</h2>
            <p>For a bachelorette party, you don't just want a good massage; you want a good "hangout" space. The best options are hotel spas, which have dedicated relaxation lounges, pools, and steam rooms that your group can use before and after treatments.</p>

            <h3>1. The Spa at The Charleston Place</h3>
            <p>This is the classic, grand dame of Charleston spas. It's pure luxury. The spa itself is massive, with a beautiful, light-filled relaxation lounge. The real selling point? Booking a treatment gives your group access to their stunning, glass-ceilinged indoor pool and rooftop terrace. You can easily spend half a day here. The 21+ crowd can order champagne, and the under-21s can enjoy the same luxe atmosphere. It's the full, "Real Housewives" bachelorette experience.</p>

            <h3>2. The Spa at Hotel Bennett</h3>
            <p>If you want modern, over-the-top luxury, this is it. The Spa at Hotel Bennett is famous for its chic, feminine decor and unique treatments. The relaxation lounge is an 'gram-worthy dream. Like The Charleston Place, a treatment gets you access to their beautiful rooftop pool, which has private cabanas you can rent for the group. It's pricey, but it's an unforgettable, A-list experience.</p>

            <h3>3. The Woodhouse Day Spa</h3>
            <p>Located on Market Street, Woodhouse is a dedicated day spa (not a hotel) that is built to handle groups. They are pros at bachelorette parties. You'll all be given plush robes and slippers and can hang out together in the "Quiet Room" between treatments. They are fantastic at scheduling multiple mani/pedis, facials, and massages at the same time. It's a bit more affordable than the hotel spas but just as luxurious and relaxing.</p>

            <h3>4. The "At Home" Option: The IZZO</h3>
            <p>Want the spa to come to *you*? This is a fantastic option for a mixed-age group. Companies like "The IZZO" or "Charleston Mobile Massage" will send a team of massage therapists and estheticians to your Airbnb. You can set up stations, play your own music, and have your own food and drinks. The under-21s are perfectly comfortable, and it's far more private and flexible than a traditional spa.</p>

            <!-- Pro-Tips -->
            <h2>How to Book a Spa Day for a Group</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Call. Do Not Book Online.</strong> This is the most important rule. Online booking systems can't handle a group of 8 people all wanting treatments at the same time. You must call and speak to a spa coordinator.</li>
                <li><strong>Book 6-8 Weeks in Advance.</strong> Do not wait until you're in Charleston. These spas, especially the hotel ones, book up *fast*. For a weekend bachelorette party, you need to lock this in months ahead of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Flexible.</strong> You may not all be able to get a 60-minute massage at 11 AM. Be open to a mix of treatments. Suggest a "menu" to your group: "You can get a 50-min facial, a classic massage, or a mani/pedi." This makes it much easier for the spa to schedule you.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask About Group Packages.</strong> Always mention you are a bachelorette party. The spa coordinator may have special packages or be able to set up a private area for you in the relaxation lounge.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <h2>The Verdict: The Ultimate Recharge</h2>
            <p>A spa day is the perfect luxurious centerpiece for your <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/under-21-bachelorette/index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">all-ages bachelorette weekend</a>. It's an activity where age is completely irrelevant. Everyone can put on a robe, sip a cucumber water, and feel pampered and included. Whether you go all-out at a hotel pool or bring the spa to your Airbnb, it's a guaranteed hit.</p>
