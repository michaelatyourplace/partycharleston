                <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Best Bachelorette Boat Tours (That Aren't Just Booze Cruises)</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">You can't come to Charleston and not get on the water. It's a non-negotiable part of any bachelorette itinerary. But when your group is all-ages, the typical "booze cruise" is off the table. The good news? The *best* boat tours aren't about the party; they're about the luxury, the views, and the dolphins.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">This is a massive win for an under-21 group. You get a far more exclusive, beautiful, and memorable experience. Here are the best all-ages boat options for a bachelorette party.</p>
            </div>

            <img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/667eea/white?text=Bachelorette+Group+on+a+Sailboat" alt="A bachelorette party group posing on the front of a sailboat" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12 w-full">

            <!-- Options -->
            <h2>The Best All-Ages Boat Options</h2>

            <h3>1. The Luxury Pick: Private Sailing Charter</h3>
            <p>This is the ultimate bachelorette move. Instead of cramming onto a public tour boat, you charter a private sailboat for just your group. Companies like "Sailing Charleston" or "Holy City Sailing" offer 2-3 hour private charters for groups of 6-20.</p>
            <p><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Pure luxury. It's just your group, a captain, and the open water. You'll sail past Fort Sumter, under the Ravenel Bridge, and along the Battery. The 21+ crowd can bring their own champagne, and the under-21 crowd can bring their favorite sparkling juices. Everyone gets to enjoy the same stunning sunset views, and the photo-ops are 10/10. It feels exclusive, sophisticated, and incredibly special.</p>

            <h3>2. The "Party Vibe" Pick: Private Tiki Hut Tour</h3>
            <p>Want something that *feels* like a party, without the 21+ rule? Book a private tiki hut boat. These floating tiki bars from companies like "Tiki Tours of Charleston" are hilarious, fun, and perfect for a bachelorette party. Because it's a private charter, you control the music and the "menu." The 21+ folks can BYOB, and the under-21s can have their mocktails. You'll cruise around Shem Creek or the harbor, blasting your party playlist, and everyone feels included. It's quirky, fun, and totally 'grammable.</p>

            <h3>3. The "Classic Charleston" Pick: Dolphin & Harbor Tour</h3>
            <p>This is the classic, can't-miss tourist experience for a reason. Companies like "Charleston Harbor Tours" run large, comfortable, multi-level boats that take you on a 90-minute narrated tour of the harbor. You'll see everything: Fort Sumter, the Battery, the bridge, and almost guaranteed, you'll be followed by pods of dolphins.
            <br>
            <strong>The Vibe:</strong> It's a relaxed, public tour. You'll be with other families and tourists, but it's a fantastic, low-stress way to see all the sights from the water. It's less of a "party" and more of a "classic Charleston experience" that everyone in the group will appreciate.</p>

            <!-- Pro-Tips -->
            <h2>Pro-Tips for Booking Your Tour</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Book a Private Charter.</strong> This is the #1 rule for a bachelorette party. Whether it's a sailboat or a tiki hut, a private boat means you control the music, the vibe, and the guest list. It's the best way to make a mixed-age group feel comfortable.</li>
                <li><strong>Always Ask About "BYOB."</strong> When booking, confirm the policy. 99% of private charters are "BYOB," which is the perfect solution for your group. The 21+ guests can bring what they want, and you can stock a cooler with fun, non-alcoholic options for everyone else.</li>
                <li><strong>Go for the Sunset Slot.</strong> The "golden hour" on the Charleston harbor is pure magic. The lighting is perfect for photos, the temperature is mild, and watching the sun set behind the city's steeples is an unforgettable experience. It's worth planning your day around.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <h2>The Verdict: Get on the Water</h2>
            <p>For an all-ages bachelorette group, skipping the "booze cruise" is a blessing. You get to upgrade to a more luxurious, private, and scenic experience that's 100x better for photos anyway. A private sailing charter or a fun tiki tour is the perfect "main event" for your <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/under-21-bachelorette/index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Charleston bachelorette weekend</a>.</p>
