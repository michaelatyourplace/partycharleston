    <p class="lead mt-3">
      Planning a girls weekend in Charleston SC? If you’re searching for a budget-friendly, respectful, and locally trusted party idea — this is one of the most affordable private show options available. You get a 90 minute show with a bachelorette entertainer of dance and interaction for $200, very straightforward.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      This is affordable because if each member paid for tickets for a show, the total cost can be double or triple the amount. There is no tip out fee plus the price never changes per size of group, there is no upselling or some sort of VIP rate, everyone is a vip.

    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Affordable Bachelorette Activity Charleston Planners Can Trust</h2>

    <p>
      When comparing options for a Charleston bachelorette party, pricing transparency matters. Many party listings advertise one price and then increase costs through upsells, surprise fees, or rotating entertainers. This local Charleston-based private show is different. <strong>It is not 800+ to paint a model, 50 bucks per person, no mandatory tip outs with deceptive low booking fees that add up to more than 200$.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The price is a flat <strong>$200 set rate</strong>. It does not change. There are no hidden charges. There is no need to submit a form and wait for price adjustments. You speak directly to a local Charleston professional.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you see is exactly what you receive — one dedicated entertainer, the same individual shown in photos, performing a respectful and fun private party show designed specifically for adult birthday celebrations and bachelorette groups.
