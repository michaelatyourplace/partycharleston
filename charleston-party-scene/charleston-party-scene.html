      <h2>Why Charleston? A quick orientation</h2>
      <p>Charleston is a compact coastal city with a lively downtown corridor, waterfront neighborhoods, and seasonal beach towns that together create a wide range of party experiences. Whether you’re a college student looking for live music and late-night eats, an adult seeking cocktail lounges and rooftop views, or an under-18 group planning a safe bachelorette or birthday celebration, Charleston has structured options that respect age limits while keeping energy high.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>College party scene — what to expect</h2>
      <p>College nightlife in Charleston centers around campus-adjacent venues, student bar nights, theme nights, and live music shows. Student-friendly spots often run drink specials and cover-free entry early in the evening; many events are hosted around homecoming, spring break, and football weekends. If you’re planning college-centered content or events, highlight safe transportation options, typical price ranges, and where students can gather before clubs enforce 21+ policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>21+ Nightlife — bars, rooftops & late-night energy</h2>
      <p>For those 21 and older, Charleston’s 21+ scene offers cocktail bars, rooftop lounges, and dance venues. King Street and the Historic District remain central hubs for after-dark outings. When writing for this audience, focus on atmosphere (cocktail lists, live DJs, cover charges), reservation tips, and how private bookings or group packages can make bachelor/bachelorette nights run smoothly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>Under-21 options — all-ages venues and events</h2>
      <p>Under-21 nightlife is thriving with all-ages concerts, family-friendly festivals, late-night food scenes, and beach gatherings. Many performance venues host all-ages shows; seasonal festivals and minor-league sporting events provide lively alternatives to bar-based nights. For under-21 visitors, emphasize event schedules, ticket policies, ID requirements, and safe meeting points.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>Under-18 bachelorette & birthday ideas</h2>
      <p>Not every bachelorette needs to be alcohol-focused. For teens and under-18 groups, suggest creative, age-appropriate options: private dance or choreography lessons, beach day retreats, escape rooms, paint-and-sip (mocktail) nights, themed photoshoots, or private venue hires. These alternatives keep the party celebratory while staying within legal limits and offering memorable experiences.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2>Safety, transportation & local tips</h2>
      <p>Include local safety tips—ride-share availability, designated-driver resources, parking guidance, and venue-age enforcement. Encourage organizers to confirm venue policies in advance, purchase tickets for popular shows early, and consider private bookings for larger groups to guarantee access. A brief local emergency and health contact list can also be helpful to visitors.</p>
