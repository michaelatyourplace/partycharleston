                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600">It's 10 PM on a Friday. You just finished a ghost tour, got out of a show at the Music Farm, or wrapped a brutal study session at the CofC library. You're not 21, but you're not ready to call it a night. Where do you go? In Charleston, the answer is unequivocally: you go for dessert.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Kaminsky's Section -->
            <h2>The Classic Contender: <a href="http://www.kaminskys.com/">Kaminsky's Dessert Café</a></h2>
            <p>Tucked away on North Market Street, Kaminsky's is a Charleston institution. The line, which often snakes out the door and down the sidewalk, is part of the experience. This is the classic "dessert date" spot, the place you take your parents, or where you huddle with friends for a long, cozy chat.</p>
            
            <h3>The Vibe: Cozy, Dim, and Classic</h3>
            <p>Walking into Kaminsky's feels like stepping into a cozy, old-school European café. The lights are dim, the walls are brick, and the vibe is intimate and relaxed. It's not a loud, party-centric place; it's a spot for conversation. Getting a table can be a wait, but once you're in, you'll want to stay for hours. It’s the perfect place to decompress.</p>

            <h3>The Desserts: Pure Decadence</h3>
            <p>This is classic American dessert-making at its peak. The rotating case features massive, multi-layered cakes—think towering chocolate fudge, rich red velvet, and gooey Toll House Pie served warm. Their milkshakes are legendary for the under-21 crowd. For mixed-age groups, they're also famous for their "adult" spirited coffees and dessert martinis, but the all-ages options are just as robust.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> A first date, a small group (2-4 people), a long chat, a classic cake craving.</li>
                <li><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Put your name on the list and then take a 15-minute walk around the market. Be prepared to wait, but know it's worth it.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Carmella's Section -->
            <h2>The Challenger: <a href="http://carmellasdessertbar.com/">Carmella's Cafe & Dessert Bar</a></h2>
            <p>If Kaminsky's is the cozy classic, Carmella's is its flashy, energetic cousin. Located on historic East Bay Street, Carmella's is bright, loud, and bustling. It's less of a quiet café and more of a social scene, a place to see and be seen.</p>
            
            <h3>The Vibe: Bright, Loud, and Social</h3>
            <p>The atmosphere is "Italian market on a Saturday night." It's an open, airy space with a massive glass counter showcasing pastries, cakes, and a rainbow of gelato. Seating is more of a free-for-all, which adds to the high-energy, communal feel. This is where you go with a group before or after another event.</p>

            <h3>The Desserts: Italian-Inspired Variety</h3>
            <p>Carmella's shines with its variety. You can get incredible gelato and sorbet, delicate pastries, cannolis, and signature items like their famous Cannoli Cake or Lemon Ricotta Cake. More importantly, they have a full savory menu of sandwiches and pizzas, making it a true one-stop-shop for a late-night bite *and* dessert. For the 21+ crowd, their espresso martinis and wine selection are a huge draw.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> A social group, a "scene," a quick gelato, when you also want savory food.</li>
                <li><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Send one friend to scout for a table while the others order at the counter. The line moves faster than Kaminsky's, but the seating is the real challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Beyond the Big Two -->
            <h2>Beyond the Big Two: Other Late-Night Heroes</h2>
            <p>While Kaminsky's and Carmella's dominate, they aren't your only options. Charleston's under-21 dessert scene has more to offer.</p>

            <h3>For the Ice Cream Connoisseur: <a href="http://jenis.com/scoop-shops/jenis-king-street/">Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams</a></h3>
            <p>On a hot Charleston night, the line for Jeni's on King Street rivals any club. This is a social hub in its own right. With unique, ultra-premium flavors like Brown Butter Almond Brittle and Gooey Butter Cake, it's a full-blown experience. Grabbing a cone and walking up and down King Street is a perfect, all-ages activity and a core part of the <a href="https://www.partycharleston.com/parties/college.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">Charleston college scene</a>.</p>

            
            <!-- Final Verdict -->
            <h2>Choose Your Own Adventure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For a classic, intimate date:</strong> Go to <strong>Kaminsky's</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>For a loud, social group outing:</strong> Go to <strong>Carmella's</strong>.</li>

            </ul>
